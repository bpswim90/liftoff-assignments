### Overview
TLDR: Pinterest for home cooks.

As an avid home cook, I am often dissatisfied with the existing landscape of cooking apps/sites. Although there are countless recipe websites, there are actually too many options. It is hard to sift through all the choices and tell which recipes are good and which are not. To make sense of the noise I find myself returning to a handful of reliable blogs and sites, that consistently deliver interesting and executable recipes. Pinterest works well for collecting these recipes, but is still clumsy in certain respects (sometimes recipes aren't labelled well, the proper ingredients aren't listed, and the search leaves something to be desired). 

To solve this problem, my cooking app will provide a recipe search that lets you filter to show only results from your favorite blogs/websites. Users will then be able to save recipes to their own collection. Users will have the ability to manage and organize their recipes (recipes to try, recipes to make again) as well as add notes (e.g. double this recipe, omit this ingredient). Users will also be able to send/share a recipe to a friend (possibly via email, text, or within the app itself). 

### Features
Recipe search (using API): Users will be able to search the internet for recipes and filter based on their favorite websites (and possibly other conditions).
User login/profile: Users will have the ability to log in and each user will have a profile. 
Recipe collection(s): Users will be able to create a recipe collection and add recipes to it. 
Share recipe (using API): Users will be able to share recipes with others via text/email.
### Technologies
I know I want to build this using a JavaScript framework, possibly React.
Edamam API for recipe search.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn React, and I'm also not sure how the backend will work.
